The Project was taken up to build a pipeline for assisting small scale businesses which generate enormous text data 
in optimizing their performance. The primary objectives of the project are to a) generate the sales report from the 
financial chat and forecast the revenues for next 12 weeks considering market relevant factors such as COVID 
infections, Vaccination etc. We have employed various text mining techniques to generate the sales report from the text 
data and used boosting algorithms to forecast the revenues.The best results we could achieve are R Squared of 0.82 
using an averaged model

1) for mining the data we have used nltk library along with some text mining techniques
2) VARMAX
3) SARIMAX
4) XGB, LGB
5) Stacking of XGB and LGB
6) Average of XGB and LGB
