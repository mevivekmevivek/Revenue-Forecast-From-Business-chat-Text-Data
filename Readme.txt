This file contains details about the code execution.

1) the data file creed3.txt is the text messages data sourced from an external business
2) the datafile covid_data.csv contains covid related information manually collected from various sources
3) the code file contains a) preprocessing module and b) machine learning module. 

4) The coding was done using Google colab with GPU support (the code will throw errors if the GPU is not connected)
5) Data upload: while executing the code you will get data upload prompt, first upload creed3.txt file and next covid_data.csv
6) the code is ordered in sequential order. We can directly run all the cells.
7) please install all the neccessary packages.
8) The exploratory data analysis and other experiments were done in other mutiple files but, for this is the main file to observe the results hence submiting this
